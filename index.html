    <h1>Rachel Moore's Evaluation Report</h1>

    <h3>Participants</h3>

    <p>Because my final project in an <a href="https://rmmv64.github.io/">online portfolio</a>, my target audience is prospective employers. At this time, I do not feel my portfolio is at a level of completion that I could feel comfortable sending it to an advertising agency at which I hope to work. Instead, I got feedback from a peer, a student and a family friend who works in corporate communication, a field I am interested in entering. </p>

    <p>Micheala Sosby is a journalism student here at MU. She specializes in convergence and digital audience engagement, so she knows a thing or two about website development. She used a Macbook Pro running El Capitan and connected to the Internet through a WiFi modem on Google Chrome. </p>

    <p>Tanya Heath is an MU journalism professor in the department of strategic communication. She has a background in advertising and health communications, both industries that I am considering for a career. Tanya used a Dell Inspiron desktop running Windows XP and connected to the Internet through an Ethernet cord on Mozilla Firefox. </p>

    <p>Linda Worsham is a director of marketing communications for American Airlines.  She focuses on website development and digital marketing, so her feedback is valuable to my final portfolio. She used her personal computer, an HP Spectre running Windows 10 and connected to the Internet through a WiFi modem on Google Chrome. </p><br />

    <p> All agreed that navigation is easy to understand and that the site is divided into logical pages. They also agree that the multimedia elements load quickly and that I provided alternative options to download files not directly embedded. All testers liked the contrast of black and blue text on a white background. </p>

    <p> Because the site is unfinished, obviously the lowest scores came from the content section. Although all agreed that links are appropriately linked and have a clear purpose, some of the links are broken due to some pages being under construction. There was also a disconnect in that testers said the site stimulates thinking and serves an identified audience, yet there were low scores on the “site contains in-depth content that encourages users to return.” </p>

    <p> Credibility scores were the highest across the board. I pride myself in keeping my contact information as current as possible and constantly checking spelling and grammar. </p>

    <p> Overall, the general consensus was that the site is credible and has a simple, effective design. However, I need to add more content and revisit the links from page to page. This will come with time as I finish the site completely. </p>

    <h3>Recommended/Planned Changes</h3>

    <p> Based on the feedback that I collected, I plan to make changes in the following areas: </p>

    <h4>Improving Design</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Empty Space: </strong>I like the aesthetic of negative space and would prefer to leave as much of that as possible. However, I realize that my site is a little plain, so I will add some banners and colored margins in an attempt to break up the blank white space. </li>

        <li><strong>Navigation: </strong>The navigation bar across the top of the site is to my standards, but I need to encourage people who view my site to visit every page. This may invovle hyperlinking other pages within text as well as drawing more attention to the navigation bar through design elements. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Updating content</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>About Me, Social Media, Work sections:</strong>These pages are all unfinished, so my first order of business is to finish coding these. They will include a variety of multimedia elements as well as links to previous work and images to support the text explanations. </li>

        <li><strong>Contact Me:</strong> Although my contact information lives on its own page, along with a form field for communication, I think it would be important to build a contact section in the margin of every page, so it is readily available to employers who may visit my site. </li>

        <li><strong>Multimedia:</strong> Both Tanya and Linda made suggestions toward adding more multimedia elements to my pages. This site will be text-heavy, so more images would break up the text and make the overall site easier to digest visually. </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Enhancing Credibility</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testimonials:</strong> I scored high on credibility, but I think my site would be taken up a notch with testimonials by previous employers and professors who know my work. This could be in the form of quotes or a video. It's a way to add tangible proof of what is included on my resumé. </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Reflections on Evaluation Process</h3>

    <p>It was very helpful for me to see my site through the eyes of my peers, professors and professionals who have experience in my desired career field. Micheala helped me realize that I need to link to other pages as frequently as possible to maximize visitation. Tanya's feedback sparked my idea to include professor and employer testimonials. Linda helped me realize the importance of contact information being in more than one place. These are all things I may not have concluded without their feedback. I want my portfolio to be visually sleek, easily navigable, professionally developed and credible. With the help of these evaluations, I think I can get there. </p>
